<h1>The HPST Minecraft Club</h1>      
<p>This website made By Nathan Arul Sripathi. Club members are Gunner And lily. </p>

<h1>What is the minecraft club?</h1>
<p>This minecraft club is about playing minecraft and making modifications to minecraft. This website will tell you all the info you need to know about our club.</p>

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Minecraft Version:</strong> You can play with any version of Minecraft—Java Edition, Bedrock Edition, Education Edition, Minecraft Dungeons, Minecraft Legends, or any other version.</li>
    <li><strong>Computer:</strong> You’ll need a computer to play and, if you want to make mods, to code.</li>
    <li><strong>Microsoft Account:</strong> To join multiplayer servers, you’ll need a Microsoft account and a username.</li>
    <li><strong>Modding Tools:</strong> If you want to create mods, you’ll need tools like IntelliJ or Eclipse for coding, Forge or Fabric, Adoptium, Blockbench, Git, and more. Don’t worry—everything we provide is safe and virus-free.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Join:</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Sign Up:</strong> To join, you must sign up on our website. You’ll be asked for personal info like your name and Minecraft username.</li>
    <li><strong>Activities:</strong> You can choose to either play Minecraft, make mods, or both! Just check the boxes for what interests you.</li>
    <li><strong>Fees:</strong> There’s no fee to join the club. However, if you want to play on servers, you’ll need Minecraft Java or Bedrock. Other versions like Minecraft Dungeons or Education Edition won’t allow server access. There’s a $12 yearly fee if you need to access servers (this is set by the team, not us).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Club Location:</h2>
<p>The club is based in Springfield, IL (USA), either at Iles School or another location. The server IP for our Minecraft club will be shared with you once you join: <strong>192.168.68.100</strong>.</p>

<h2>Club Activities:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Survival Mode:</strong> If you're joining the Minecraft server, you'll need to build a base and craft a wooden sword to survive in the game.</li>
    <li><strong>Modding:</strong> If you're interested in making mods, you’ll receive all the tools you need and be guided on how to create them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Music:</h2>
<p>We also have some songs created by Nathan Arul Sripathi, which were made specifically for the club!</p>

<h2>Note on Payment:</h2>
<p>This is a <strong>school project</strong> created by kids (ages 8). You cannot pay us, and we will not pay you, even if you help with modding or other activities. The goal is to have fun, learn, and create, not to make money.</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest, and we look forward to having you join the Minecraft Club!</p>

      <p>This is me. My name is Nathan Arul Sripathi. I was born on March 23, 2016. I am currently 8 years old and today is December 8, 2024—I'm almost 9. I want to become an electronic engineer, but also, for a kid like me, I enjoy programming apps and other fun stuff, like YouTube. I made this website because my teacher Mrs. Tonstad told me and my classmates to create clubs, not actual ones, but like learning clubs. So, I joined up with Lily and Gunner to make a Minecraft club. This isn't really real, except for the server, which is totally real. I made it, so thank you for checking out this website! I hope you have a great day! Here's the link to the form where you can fill out information to join my Minecraft server:</p>
